### I wish to help, what's the basics to what I need to know?

first and foremost, thank you for your help and interest.

second, never **ever** write your code on master. Any PR that's merging into master will be asked to redo it to merge to develop. master is reserved 
for what's going to be pushed to nuget.

this repo will be using git flow, which allows us to create clean and organized branches.

### Adding a new feature

create a feature branch using git flow.

### Fixing a bug

create a bugfix branch using git flow.
